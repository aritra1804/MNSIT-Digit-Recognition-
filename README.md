# **Handwritten Digit Detection using CNN**

In this project, we are going to implement a handwritten digit recognition app using the MNIST dataset.The MNIST dataset contains 60,000 training images of handwritten digits from zero to nine and 10,000 images for testing. 

The handwritten digits images are represented as a 28Ã—28 matrix where each cell contains grayscale pixel value.For this project, I used Convolutional Neural Networks to train the model. In the end, I also built a GUI feature in which you can draw the digit and recognize it straight away.
